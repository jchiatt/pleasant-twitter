# Pleasant Twitter

> Inspiration for words to mute on Twitter. Forked from [sindresorhus/twitter-mute-words](https://github.com/sindresorhus/twitter-mute-words), but more balanced to tell both the left AND the right to get out of your feed.

Twitter supports [muting tweets](https://twitter.com/settings/muted_keywords) with specific words from your timeline.

Note that Twitter limits it to 100 entries, so pick the ones most important to you.

Contributions welcome, but it should be generally useful and not offensive. The list is lowercase and alphabetically sorted.
